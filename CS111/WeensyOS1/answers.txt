Exercise 1:
It should return the correct answer.
The use of schedule() instead of run() will cause the SYS_GETPID for this process 
be called later after the running of other processes, but the result of this call
should return the same answer because this process should not be affected or 
modified by other processes. When this process is called, its register values will
be load back from its stack to the registers and so we should still get its correct
answer.

Exercise 3:
I added a wait_pid to indicate another process the current process is waiting for if
the current process is blocked.
In addition, I added some extra code in schedule() to unlock all locked process if 
the process they waiting for have exited.

Exercise 4:
The bug was that the process of with a zombie status will not be cleaned up and that
slot will not be emptied afterwards. Thus, by modifying that part of code in interrupt() 
we can clean these up and fix this bug.

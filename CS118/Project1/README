Specifications
==============
Timeout: 10 sec
DEBUG mode Switch on/off by comment/decomment "#define DEBUG"
      (shows all buffers, etc)

Currently switching day saving time off  when calculating time, changable by change value of "DST" from 0 to 1 

When a server is unreachable, and a cache is available despite its expire status, this cache will be sent to client 

BUG
===
I can successfully pass test cases in http-test.py  and conditional-get-LA
But failed to pass conditional-get (only can pass one test script by changing code, as calculating time by use "difftime")

	
General
=======

To learn more about ./waf, refer to http://code.google.com/p/waf/
and http://waf.googlecode.com/svn/docs/wafbook/single.html

Ideally, you will need only to add your source files in wscript, which is basically a Python program.

How to use skeleton
===================

Due to restrictions on lnxsrv, several steps necessary to compile and run (if you're using this skeleton):

1. The following lines should be added to your ~/.bashrc

export PATH=/usr/local/cs/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/u/cs/grad/yingdi/boost/lib:/usr/local/lib64/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

2. To configure environment

./waf configure

If there are any errors, please email me: iliamo@ucla.edu 
Please, mark your message with [CS118] header

3. To build/rebuild the code

./waf

4. All compiled executables are located in build/, so you can run them as this:

build/http-proxy

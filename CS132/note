Though the full specification defines many built-in operations, for your homework you are only allowed to use the following:

Add, Sub, MulS
Eq, Lt, LtS
PrintIntS
HeapAllocZ
Error
The full specification allows computed goto instructions, where the target address is specified by a register. For your homework, goto can only refer to code labels.

The full specification allows strings everywhere. For your homework, strings are only allowed as arguments to the Error built-in.

ERROR CHECK:
null pointers and array out-of-bounds access
